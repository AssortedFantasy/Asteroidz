Final Project: Asteroidz

Description:
    Asteroidz is a clone of the classic arcade game asteroidz recreated in
    Pygame. The game has additional gameplay mechanics added in the form
    of powerups which makes the gameplay much more fun and enjoyable, albeit a
    bit overpowered.

Included Files:
    * README
    * game.py
    * asteroids.py
    * algorithms.py
    * menus.py
    * testing_minimum_spanning_trees.py
    * Assets folder

Running Instructions:
    1. Run the game.py script with "python3 game.py"
    2. For fun with Prim's algorithm run testing_minimum_spanning_trees.py
        * Details in "Notes"

Gameplay instructions:
    1. Click the new game button on the menu to start a new game
        * The controls are as follows:
            * Up / W - Accelerate forwards
            * Down / S - Accelerate backwards
            * Right / D - Rotate clockwise
            * Left / A - Rotate counter-clockwise
            * Space - Shoot

    3. Shoot the asteroids to break them and increase your score, getting hit by asteroids will reduce your health
            * When you get hit or a new game starts you are given temporary invulnerability
              for a few seconds. When your flashing you cannot collide with Asteroids.

    4. Power-Ups will often drop when asteroids are destroyed (except when you collide into them)
        * The power-ups are as follows:
            * The BitCoin: Increases score by 10
            * The Juice: Makes you temporarily impervious
                - You do not take any damage from getting hit by asteroids
                - But they will break on impact and drop powerups when they do so.
            * The Bolt: Zaps every asteroid on screen
                - Deals only one damage to every asteroid, larger asteroids have more than one health.
                - Destroys asteroids and does not drop powerups
            * The Missile Barrage: Shoots missiles in a circle around you
            * The Heart: Increases your health by 1, up to a maximum of 6 health

     5. One can get to the next level by destroying all asteroids, the game ends when health falls to 0

Notes, Assumptions and Dependencies:
    - At minimum you require PyGame installed and need to use Python 3.6
    - Its recommended that you use Python 3.7 and use the latest version of PyGame

    - The game is surprisingly fun to play! Please go ahead and try it

    - On "testing_minimum_spanning_trees.py"
        * Testing_minimum_spanning_teees.py is a small utility file which allows you to
        play with minimum spanning trees. Same dependency on PyGame as the main game.
        * The full list of controls are:
            - Click anywhere to add a point
            - Use spacebar to add a random point
            - Use P to add 10 random points
            - Q computes and displays the spanning tree for the points shown. (It doesn't live update)
            - W will clear all the points (but not remove the spanning tree, use Q on a clear board)
