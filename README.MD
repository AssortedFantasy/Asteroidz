# Asteroidz

## Description

Asteroidz is a clone of the classic arcade game asteroids recreated in PyGame.
The game has been extended through the used of "powerups" which spawn randomly
when players break asteroids which fly around the map.

## Running the Game

You can launch asteroids through game.py in the main directory. You need at least 
Python 3.6 because of f-strings and basically any version of pygame.

The game is actually pretty fun and you can read more about the gameplay in the
other README file.

## Authors and Purpose

Asteroidz was built in around ~8 hrs by Jehanzeb Mirza and Tharidu Witharana. It is
our final project which we built for our CMPUT 274 University course at the university
of Alberta. The project rubric is also why its organized so strangely with the other
README file.

## Example Footage

Heres around 2 minutes of gameplay footage to whet your appetite
